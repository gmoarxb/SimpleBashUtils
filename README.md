# SimpleBashUtils

Development of Bash text utilities: cat, grep.

## Introduction

In this project I will learn and develop basic Bash utilities for working with C programming language texts. These utilities (cat and grep) are often used in the Linux terminal. As part of the project Iâ€™ll learn the organization of the Bash utilities and solidify knowledge of structured programming.

## cat Usage

`cat [OPTION] [FILE]...`

Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.

### cat Options

| No. | Options | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | -b (GNU: --number-nonblank) | numbers only non-empty lines |
| 2 | -e implies -v (GNU only: -E the same, but without implying -v) | but also display end-of-line characters as $  |
| 3 | -n (GNU: --number) | number all output lines |
| 4 | -s (GNU: --squeeze-blank) | squeeze multiple adjacent blank lines |
| 5 | -t implies -v (GNU: -T the same, but without implying -v) | but also display tabs as ^I  |

## grep Usage

`grep [OPTION]... PATTERNS [FILE]...`

Search for PATTERNS in each FILE.

### grep Options

| 7 | -h | Output matching lines without preceding them by file names. |
